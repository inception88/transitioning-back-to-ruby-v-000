# Transitioning Back to Ruby

Congratulations on completing the HTML and CSS introduction! You have now completed all the Procedural Ruby lessons(This is the next section prior to object oriented Ruby). 

The upcoming Object Oriented Ruby section will focus our attention back to Ruby, but it will also leverage our understanding of the HTML document structure and CSS selectors (ID, class, and type) during the ruby 'web scraping' lessons (programmatically extract data from web pages). You will also use your current HTML and CSS knowledge during the more advanced HTML and CSS lessons at the end of the Rack section.

Best of luck for the Object Oriented Ruby section and congratulations for all the hard work.
